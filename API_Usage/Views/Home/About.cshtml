        <h2>About Q-Stock Application</h2>
        <hr />

        <div>
            <p>
                This application let's you quickly (Q) fetch stock data from IEX via their public
                <a target="_blank" href="https://iextrading.com/developer/">API</a>. This site is conceptually very similar to Yahoo Finance
                <br />
                <br />
                For the purpose of this assignment we have chosen to display the details regarding News (On Home Page), Symbols, Upcoming IPO's, and Watchlists.
                <br />
                <br />
                The <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Symbols">Symbols</a> tab shows a company list (limited to 500) from which you can
                select one to check out diverse information including price/volume chart, key stats, finances, and dividens. The information
                is pulled from our SQL database which is populated from the IEX API. Once a Symbol is selected it is shown an Update button that will
                pull updated data from the API that will update the database for that specific Symbol.
                <br />
                The <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="IPO">Upcoming IPO</a> tab let's you view the IPO [Initial public offering] issued by companies to the public.
                The IPO's list is saved in the local database. The data is obtained from
                <a target="_blank" href="https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/#ipo-calendar">IEX IPO API</a>
                <br />
                The <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Watchlists">Watchlist</a> section let you check the most active stocks, the gainers and the losers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application demonstrates the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Connection to REST API (the example uses IEXTrading, an easy-to-use API that provides stock data)</li>
                    <li>Parsing the Json objects returned from the API</li>
                    <li>Modeling API results as entities</li>
                    <li>Persisting data to a relational database</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
